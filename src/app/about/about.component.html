  <h1>Welcome to The Barkmont</h1>

  <p>The Barkmont provides the finest dog daycare and boarding services in Berkeley and its surrounding communities.
    We're located at the corner of San Pablo and Pardee in West Berkeley, convenient locally and a few short blocks
    away from the Ashby and University exits of the I80/580.</p>

  <h2>Take a virtual tour!</h2>

  <p>We remodelled the building with a design focused on providing the highest quality dog daycare and
    boarding services in the Bay Area, a job that included updating the plumbing and electricity, adding floor drains,
    and installing modern heating and ventilation systems.</p>

  <h2>Our Focus</h2>

  <h3>Daycare</h3>

  <p>A highlight of The Barkmont is our four indoor play yards. Our main yards sit under large skylights
    that soak the building in warm sunlight throughout the day. Complementing our main yards are smaller adjacent yards
    for senior dogs, puppies or dogs who do best in smaller play groups.</p>

  <p>Our yards are equipped with high-resolution web cams for you to check in on your pup from your computer
    or smart phone.
  </p>

  <h3>Boarding</h3>

  <p>Our overnight guests enjoy clean and comfortable sleeping accommodations that come with a soft bed, clean blankets
    and access to fresh water at all times. At bedtime we provide a calming spa-like atmosphere with aromatherapy and
    soft soothing music to send our canine guests gently to sleep.</p>
