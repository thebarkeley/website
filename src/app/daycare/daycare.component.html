  <h1>Playtime at The Barkeley</h1>

  <p>At The Barkeley we know that dogs have an instinctual desire to be part of a pack. Giving your pup regular play
    time with other dogs has a number of benefits. Here are a few that top the list:</p>

  <ul class="barkeley-list circle">
    <li>Increases socialization, both with other dogs and people
    </li>
    <li>Reinforces positive behavior in other settings, including and importantly, your own home
    </li>
    <li>Promotes physical fitness
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><img class="barkeley-shadow-box float-right" src="../assets/img/amber.jpg">The daycare program at The Barkeley is
    cageless and designed to encourage open play among the dogs in our care. We have over 3,000sf of newly appointed
    indoor yards - they are sunny and feature modern climate control and drainage systems. Your dog will have a full day
    of socializing, safe play, and lounging about with friends at The Barkeley, ready to come home with you in the
    evening happy and ready to kick back.</p>

  <p>We place dogs in play groups based on size and temperament to ensure each dog's health, safety and happiness. And
    every dog spends their day under the constant supervision of our staff. And we've equipped each yard with a high
    resolution web cam so you can check in on your pet throughout the day from your computer or smart phone.
    You'll see firsthand how attentive our yard specialists are with your dog.
  </p>

  <p>Before staying with us, we'll meet with you and your dog to ensure they will be a good fit for open play.</p>

  <h1>A Team You Can Trust</h1>

  <p>The Barkeley's team of dog care professionals will provide a safe and fully supervised environment. Our yard
    attendants are trained on dog body language and behavior to ensure the safety and well being of the dogs in our
    care.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our team will take detailed notes on your dogâ€™s activities, allowing us to easily identify subtle behavioral changes
