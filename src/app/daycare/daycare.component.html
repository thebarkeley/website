  <h1>Playtime at The Barkmont</h1>

  <p>The daycare program at The Barkmont is cageless and designed to encourage open play among the dogs in our care. We
    have over 2,000sf of indoor yards - they are sunny and feature modern climate control and drainage systems. Your dog
    will have a full day of socializing, safe play, and lounging about with friends at The Barkmont, ready to come home
    with you in the evening happy and ready to kick back.</p>

  <p><img class="barkeley-shadow-box float-right" src="../assets/img/amber.jpg">We place dogs in play groups based on
    size and temperament to ensure each dog's health, safety and happiness. And every dog spends their day under the
    constant supervision of our staff.
  </p>

  <p>Before staying with us, we'll meet with you and your dog to ensure they will be a good fit for open play.</p>

  <h2>A Team You Can Trust</h2>

  <p>The Barkmont's team of dog care professionals ensure your dog is in a safe and happy environment. We supervise play
    closely and take detailed notes on your dogâ€™s activities, allowing us to easily identify subtle behavioral changes
    that may indicate possible health issues. Because we're a boutique facility, we can give your dog the time and
    attention they deserve.
